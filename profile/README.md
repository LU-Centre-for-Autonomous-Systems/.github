 Based at Loughborough University, the Loughborough University Centre for Autonomous Systems (LUCAS) is a specialised research group, focusing on research in aerospace control. Comprised of both students and research professionals, LUCAS has strong links to many industrial partners and primarily works on research for unmanned applications. In addition to industry backed research, a large part of LUCAS is post graduate study, allowing for investigation into areas not currently commercially explored.
